## Goals for this week's Tidy Tuesday 
-  include an image of a numbat 
-  use world map in plotting data 
-  practice with a new type of theme 

![Introducing the numbat!](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5308542ce4b0dd985a42b5ef/1395619568126-2FTO0VO0G0Z8NTGD6WVZ/about.jpg?format=1500w)

## Load libraries 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(praise)
library(beyonce)
library(ggthemes)
??ggthemes()
library(devtools)
library(patchwork)
library(ggmap)
library(ggsn)
library(maps)
library(mapdata)
library(mapproj)
library(gridExtra)
```

## Read in data 
```{r}
numbats <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-03-07/numbats.csv')
```

## Before cleaning data, let's download map and set basics 
```{r, testmaps, echo=FALSE}
## got to put in the API code, remember to DELETE IT after you are done loading it 
#already wrote it in so don't include it here anymore... that is what got me into trouble earlier 
 
#get map for Australia --> this is from R gallery and doesn't use API code
#Australiamap <- get_googlemap("Australia", zoom=4, maptype = "satellite")
#Australiamap

##this one uses actual google maps 
Australia_map2 <- get_map("Australia", zoom=4, maptype = "terrain")
ggmap(Australia_map2)

Perth <- get_map("Perth, Australia", zoom=7, maptype="terrain")
ggmap(Perth)

##some notes: 
#terrain = city names and looks like google map 
#satellite = topography 
#watercolor= hella aesthetic 

## add a base layer? and coordinates may come later? 

## don't need this rn 
##world<-map_data("world")

```

## Now time for tidying the data
Remember that if you try to use View(), error codes will prevent you from knitting the html doc because of a weird formatting thing. 

```{r}

checkdata <- numbats %>% 
  distinct(scientificName) ##isolates just one column and all the names in that column, was curious how many diff spp there were  
checkdata

#originally dropped all NAs but that eliminated all the info other than from right near Perth 
numbat_info <- numbats %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  select(decimalLatitude:decimalLongitude, year:day) %>% ## selects only these columns 
  arrange(year, month) ##orders the years and months in chronological order 

##currently loving R and figuring out how to manipulate datasets and tidying data :) 

```


## Plot the Data! 

```{r, numbatlocations}
## plot the data 
plot1 <- ggmap(Australia_map2) +
  theme_map() + 
  ggtitle("Satellite Map of Australia") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(colour = "black"), 
        panel.border = element_rect(colour = "grey", fill=NA, size=2)) + ##puts a nice border
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + ##centers title 
#now it's time to add numbat data
  geom_point(data=numbat_info, 
             aes(x=decimalLongitude, 
                 y=decimalLatitude), 
             size=4) 
plot1

## okay so they are really close together lol let's do another map zooming in
#- maybe add the picture of the numbat to this map? 


plot2 <- ggmap(Perth) + 
  theme_void() + 
  ggtitle("Satellite Map of Australia") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(colour = "black"), 
        panel.border = element_rect(colour = "grey", fill=NA, size=2)) + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
  geom_point(data=numbat_info, 
             aes(x=decimalLongitude, 
                 y=decimalLatitude), 
             size=1) 
plot2
  
```


## Summary  
This week I finally learned how to use maps!! I can easily get sucked down a Tidy Tuesday wormhole with this new information. 
I was also reminded not to necessarily drop all NAs from the entire dataset because that limited a lot of my data to recent years and a limited geographic space. 
Played with new themes in Markdown and also was very determined to include a picture :) cutie little numbats!
